# PICrs

This is a Picross/Nonogram solver in progress.
Currently only does a single pass looking at individual lines, meaning only trivial problems can be automated

## Goals

- [ ] Parse problem input (format TBD)
- [ ] Find all guaranteed solids and spaces
- [ ] Assist mode: Only automate the first pass, leaving the fun puzzle solving for the user
